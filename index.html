  <h2>UNION SQUARE RENTERS</h2>
  <h3>Socialist Tenants Association</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Somerville is rapidly changing, and it's about to get a lot worse. A private equity firm from Chicago that calls itself US2 has conspired with the mayor to turn Union Square into a bland wasteland of condos, biotech labs, and high-end stores. The urban renewal plan—known as "The Green Line Extension"—is a general plan to attract the sprawl around MIT, Kendall Square, and Lechmere (re-branded as "North Point") into the residential village of Somerville, along the planned MBTA train line. This means new technology companies, military contractors, pharmaceutical businesses, luxury apartments, condominiums, and investment real estate buildings: whole zones and tracts of land built not for <i>use</i> as housing, but as means to make a profit. The mayor, Joe Curtatone, even begs for the tech giant Amazon to build a headquarters in our backyard. The mayor and US2 claim that Union Square can become an "innovation district," a vibrant new employment hub to benefit all. But in fact, this is just another urban renewal plan where rich people win and poor people lose out. They want to sell <i>our public land</i>to high-income shoppers, wealthy students, and white professionals. As rent goes up, poor renters and immigrants will be pushed out. New businesses will crowd out older ones. White people will take over the sidewalks, and try to erase people of color. In short, this is textbook gentrification, in which struggling communities are colonized and displaced by capitalists.</p>
 <p>Join us in stopping this nightmare. We are building a solidarity network against the landlords and developers, the leeches who weild unilateral power over us, the tenants. We want to form blocks of renters to discuss housing, neighborhood life, and concerns around rent and living conditions. We want to find common ground, and form collective strength. We want to defend public housing and help build new public housing. As the renters of Union Square, we want to take power back from the capitalists and the corrupt city hall, whose patronage network extends into the bloated offices of the Somerville Redevelopment Authorty, the Housing Authority, and the Police Department. We want to strike fear in the hearts of developers. We want to stop and reverse gentrification, and put forth a radical new vision of our community. We, the Union Square Renters, imagine a different future for Somerville, in which the rich do not get a say, and the workers have control.</p>
