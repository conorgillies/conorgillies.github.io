  <h1>UNION SQUARE RENTERS</h1>
  <h2>A Socialist Tenants Association</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Somerville is rapidly changing, and it's about to get a lot worse. A private equity firm from Chicago that calls itself "US2" has conspired with the mayor to turn Union Square into a bland wasteland of luxury condos, biotech labs, and high-end shopping centers. As part of "The Green Line Extension," city hall is trying to attract the sprawl of tech firms, military contractors, pharmaceutical companies, and high-end apartments and condos currently circling MIT and Kendall Square up north into the residential village of Somerville. The mayor, Joe Curtatone, even begs for the tech giant Amazon to come build a headquarters in our backyard. In short, the mayor and US2 want to develop <i>our public land</i> into Massachusetts's next "innovation district"â€”bringing in high-income shoppers, wealthy students, and white professionals to take over our city. Poor renters and immigrants will be displaced. This is a process known as gentrification, in which communities of color are colonized by capitalists.</p>
 <p>Join us in stopping this disaster. We are building a solidarity network against the landlords and developers, the leeches who weild unilateral power over us, the tenants. We want to form blocks of renters to discuss housing, neighborhood life, and concerns around rent and living conditions. We want to find common ground, and form collective strength. As the renters of Union Square, we want to take power back from the corrupt city hall, whose patronage network extends into the bloated offices of the Somerville Redevelopment Authorty, the Housing Authority, and the Police Department. We want to strike fear in the hearts of outside developers. We want to stop and reverse gentrification, putting forth a radical new vision for our community. We imagine a different future for Somerville, in which the rich do not get a say in our collective future.</p>
